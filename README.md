# NavDrawerDemo
Quizzing app development. What is here works but it is not complete or documented fully yet (it will eventually be described fully at http://eagle.phys.utk.edu/guidry/android). The project also includes a Java code that presents a graphical user interface to construct JSON files of quiz questions for input to the app.  It works, but is not yet included in this repository.
