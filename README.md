# Quizzer
Quizzing app in development. What is here works but it is not complete or documented fully yet (it will eventually be described fully at http://eagle.phys.utk.edu/guidry/android, under Quizzing Application in the table of contents). The project also includes a Java program that should run on a Window, Mac, or Linux machine to present a graphical user interface permitting construction of JSON files of quiz questions for input to the app.  It works, but is not yet included in this repository.
